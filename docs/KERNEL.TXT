HOW TO REBUILT THE ANDROID EMULATOR-SPECIFIC KERNEL:
====================================================

You need to have the Android toolchain in your path
(i.e. 'arm-eabi-gcc --version' must work)

then:

git clone git://android.git.kernel.org/kernel/common.git kernel-common
cd kernel-common
git checkout origin/android-goldfish-2.6.29

export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm
make goldfish_defconfig    # configure the kernel
make -j2                   # build it

=> this generates a file named arch/arm/boot/zImage

NOTE: Branch android-goldfish-2.6.27 is obsolete now. Do not use it.

Now, you can use it with:

  emulator -kernel path/to/your/new/zImage <other-options>


You can build an ARMv7-compatible kernel image by using goldfish_armv7_defconfg
in the above instructions (instead of goldfish_defconfig). Note that you will
need to enable ARMv7 emulation by using the -cpu cortex-a8 option, as in:

  emulator -kernel path/to/your/new/zImage <other-options> -qemu -cpu cortex-a8

As a special convenience, if the name of your kernel image ends in -armv7, then
the emulator binary will automatically enable ARMv7 emulation for you, so doing
the following should be equivalent

  emulator -kernel path/to/your/kernel-armv7 <other-options>


Voila !
